Renter is a hotel booking website that allows users to seamlessly book hotels, manage their properties, and enjoy a convenient booking experience. The platform is built using Node.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, and Express.js for handling server-side logic. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, while the backend is deployed on Render.

- **Hotel Booking**: Users can search for hotels, view details, and book their desired rooms for their preferred dates.

- **Property Management**: Users can list their properties, providing detailed information to attract potential guests.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using modern technologies such as React.js, allowing for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
